# GraphingCalc

A basic Graphing Calculator which I developed back when I was in school.

- This calculator the values of the coefficents of a 'line' or 'circle' equations as inputs from the user. 
- Then it calculates the values like slope, x intercepts, y intercepts in case of a line, and radius, the coordinates of the center, intercepts in case of circle.
- Then it plots the graphs of the line or the circle.

> Please note that Borland Turbo C compiler is used for compiling the code.
